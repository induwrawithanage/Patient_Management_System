Prerequisites

Node.js: v14 or higher
npm: Comes with Node.js
Database: MongoDB (recommended) or PostgreSQL
Git: For cloning the repository

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/patient-management-system.git
cd patient-management-system

Frontend Initialization

Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd Frontend


Install dependencies:
npm install


Start the development server:
npm run dev

The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173 (or as configured in your setup).


Backend Initialization

Navigate to the backend directory:
cd Backend


Install dependencies:
npm install


Create a .env file in the Backend folder with the following variables:
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

Replace your_database_connection_string with your MongoDB or PostgreSQL connection string, and your_jwt_secret_key with a secure key for JWT.

Start the backend development server:
npm run dev

The backend API will be available at http://localhost:3000 (or as configured).


Environment Variables
The backend requires a .env file in the Backend directory with the following variables:

PORT: Port for the backend server (e.g., 3000)
DATABASE_URL: Database connection string (e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/patient-management)
JWT_SECRET: Secret key for JWT authentication (e.g., a random string like mysecretkey123)

Note: Ensure the .env file is listed in .gitignore to prevent exposing sensitive information.
Running the Application

Start the backend server (npm run dev in the ` człowie

System: Backend directory). 2. Start the frontend server (npm run devin theFrontenddirectory). 3. Open your browser and navigate tohttp://localhost:5173` to access the application.
Ensure both servers are running concurrently for full functionality. The frontend communicates with the backend via API calls, so the backend must be accessible.
Troubleshooting

Frontend-Backend Connection Issues: Verify the API base URL in the frontend configuration (e.g., in Frontend/src/config.js) matches the backend URL (http://localhost:3000). Check CORS settings in the backend (Backend/src/index.js).
Database Connection Errors: Ensure your database is running and the DATABASE_URL in the .env file is correct. For MongoDB, confirm the MongoDB service is active (mongod).
Dependency Errors: Delete the node_modules folder and package-lock.json in the affected directory (Frontend or Backend), then run npm install again.
Port Conflicts: If ports 3000 or 5173 are in use, update the PORT in the backend .env file or the frontend configuration.

For additional help, check the console logs for specific error messages or refer to the documentation of the technologies used.
